**Postrequisites**: This course is a prerequisite for 
[CSCE 310](https://catalog.unl.edu/search/?P=CSCE%20310) - Data
Structures & Algorithms. A grade of C or better is required to move on
to CSCE 310.

## Skills Objectives

Throughout the duration of this course, you will be presented with a lot
of information, some of which will have immediate application and some
whose importance is not immediately apparent. As a different measure of
your success in this course, by the end, you should have the following
skills.

-   Be able to more easily pick up and learn a new programming language
    on your own

-   Be able to recognize, use, design and appreciate programs with an
    Object Oriented flavor

-   Be able to design a database-backed application from scratch given a
    general problem statement

-   Be able to understand and implement basic data structures as well as
    recognize how and when to leverage appropriate simple data
    structures

-   Be able to identify and analyze basic algorithms

Overall, CS2 is a continuation of CS1. At the end of a typical CS1
course, you should be able to approach a reasonably complex problem,
design a top-down solution, and code a program in a high-level
programming language. By the end of this course your approach to problem
solving should be modified to ask and answer design questions first:

-   What entities/objects would be appropriate to model this problem?

-   How would these objects interact to solve the problem?

-   What data structures would be the most appropriate or efficient to
    use?

## Tentative Topics

-   Introduction to Java / PHP (Honors section)

-   Object Oriented Programming, OOP in Java

-   Database Design, SQL, Database Connectivity (JDBC), multi-tier
    design

-   Lists (array-based, linked; circular doubly-linked), Stacks & Queues

-   Algorithm Analysis, Recursion, Searching & Sorting

-   Trees; Binary Search Trees

## COVID-19 Accommodations & Policies

Several sections of this course have been established for the spring 2021
offering in order to accommodate a variety of student attendance preferences.

* Section 150 - This **In-Person** course meets TR 11:00AM - 12:15AM and is
delivered in a hybrid mode where students are welcome to attend in person as 
often as social distancing and room restrictions allow.  Currently, students 
will be allowed to come every other lecture based on the following schedule.  
  * If your NUID ends with an even number, you *may* attend lecture in
    person on Tuesdays, but *must* attend remotely on Thursdays
  * If your NUID ends with an odd number, you *may* attend lecture in
    person on Thursdays, but *must* attend remotely on Tuesdays
Students *may* opt to attend remotely for all lectures.  For those attending
remotely, all lectures are livestreamed via YouTube during the regular lecture 
time.  Live Q&A will be available through Piazza.  Recordings of the lecture 
are provided immediately after through YouTube.

* Section 160 - This **Web Conferencing** section is the same course as section
150, however students in this section *must* attend lecture remotely for all
lectures and may not attend lectures in person.

* Section 700 - This **Online** section is the same course as section 150 but
is a purely online section.  Students must attend remotely for all lectures
and labs.  

### Labs

Students in sections 150 and 160 may choose to attend their lab section either 
in-person or remotely (via zoom).  Students in the online 700 section will 
complete their labs remotely but may attend virtual lab sessions via zoom.  

### Office Hours

All office hours by instructors and Learning Assistants will be offered 
*online only* via zoom.  

### Face Covering Policy

**Required Use of Face Coverings for On-Campus Shared Learning Environments**

As of July 17, 2020 and until further notice, all University of 
Nebraska--Lincoln (UNL) faculty, staff, students, and visitors 
(including contractors, service providers, and others) are required 
to use a facial covering at all times when indoors except under 
specific conditions outlined in the COVID 19 face covering policy 
found at: <https://covid19.unl.edu/face-covering-policy>. This 
statement is meant to clarify classroom policies for face coverings:

To protect the health and well-being of the University and wider 
community, UNL has implemented a policy requiring all people, 
including students, faculty, and staff, to wear a face covering 
that covers the mouth and nose while on campus. The classroom is 
a community, and as a community, we seek to maintain the health 
and safety of all members by wearing face coverings when in the 
classroom. Failure to comply with this policy is interpreted as 
a disruption of the classroom and may be a violation of UNL's 
Student Code of Conduct.

Individuals who have health or medical reasons for not wearing 
face coverings should work with the Office of Services for 
Students with Disabilities (for students) or the Office of 
Faculty/Staff Disability Services (for faculty and staff) to 
establish accommodations to address the health concern. Students 
who prefer not to wear a face covering should work with their 
advisor to arrange a fully online course schedule that does 
not require their presence on campus.

Students in the classroom:
  * If a student is not properly wearing a face covering, 
  the instructor will remind the student of the policy and ask 
  them to comply with it.
  * If the student will not comply with the face covering policy, 
  the instructor will ask the student to leave the classroom, 
  and the student may only return when they are properly wearing 
  a face covering.
  * If the student refuses to properly wear a face covering 
  or leave the classroom, the instructor will dismiss the class 
  and will report the student to Student Conduct & Community 
  Standards for misconduct, where the student will be subject 
  to disciplinary action.

Instructors in the classroom:
  * If an instructor is not properly wearing a face covering, 
  students will remind the instructor of the policy and ask them 
  to comply with it.
  * If an instructor will not properly wear a face covering, 
  students may leave the classroom and should report the misconduct 
  to the department chair or via the TIPS system for disciplinary 
  action through faculty governance processes.

### Social Distancing & Attendance

Due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, the following 
policies and accommodations will be made for this course.  

  * No assessment will be made based on any synchronous attendance 
  for instructional sessions (which includes lecture, lab, hack, and 
  office hours).  Attendance of any face-to-face instructional session
  is **entirely optional** and is left to each student's own 
  reasonable judgement.  If you have a medical condition or other 
  consideration or simply do not wish to unnecessarily expose yourself
  or others to potential infection, you are *encouraged* to refrain
  from any and all face-to-face sessions.  You will not be judged 
  nor will you be required to provide any documentation.
  
  * If you feel sick, have a fever or other related symptoms of
  think you may have been exposed to a COVID-19 positive individual, you
  *may not* attend face-to-face sessions.  Please attend remotely.

### Self-Care Curricular Adjustments

The UNL Faculty Senate passed a [resolution](https://www.unl.edu/facultysenate/senate/Resolutions/Spring%202021%20Curriculum%20resolution.pdf) on 
December 1st, 2020 encouraging instructors to make adjustments to 
courses and curricula in an effort to promote self-care and to 
relieve stress and promote mental well-being during the pandemic 
crisis.

As such, the following accommodations and changes have been made
to this course:
 - The midterm exam and final exam have been eliminated
 - The final assignment (assignment 8, typically a written, 
   theory-based assignment) is still assigned and required, but 
   it will not be graded.
 - The number of labs has been reduced to 14 to accommodate the
   COVID schedule.  Further, we will drop your lowest lab grade.
 - For those in the honors section, the usual requirement that 
   "bonus" items are required and part of your regular grade will
   be removed and the items will be optional and treated as bonus
   if completed.

## University Services

### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

The University strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as
possible. If you anticipate or experience barriers based on your
disability (including mental health, chronic or temporary medical
conditions), please let me know immediately so that we can discuss
options privately. To establish reasonable accommodations, I may request
that you register with [Services for Students with Disabilities](https://www.unl.edu/ssd/) 
(SSD). If you are eligible for services and register with their office, make
arrangements with me as soon as possible to discuss your accommodations
so they can be implemented in a timely manner. SSD contact information:
117 Louise Pound Hall; 402-472-3787.

### Counseling and Psychological Services

UNL offers a variety of options to students to aid them in dealing with
stress and adversity. [Counseling and Psychological Services](https://caps.unl.edu/) 
(CAPS) is a multidisciplinary team of psychologists and counselors that works
collaboratively with Nebraska students to help them explore their
feelings and thoughts and learn helpful ways to improve their mental,
psychological and emotional well-being when issues arise. CAPS can be
reached by calling 402-472-7450. Big Red Resilience & Well-Being
provides fun events, innovative education, and dynamic services to help
students understand emotions, manage stress, build strength, connect
with others, develop grit and navigate transitions.

## Assessment

Assessment (grading) will be based on labs and assignments.  There are 14 labs, 
20 points each comprising about 26% of your grade.  There will be several 
assignments whose point values vary, but whose total will comprise the 
remaining 76% of your final grade.

| Category    | Number | Points |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| Labs        | 13     | 260    |
| Assignments | 7      | 740    |
| Total       |        | 1000   |

### Scale

Final letter grades will be awarded based on the following standard
scale. This scale may be adjusted upwards if the instructor deems it
necessary based on the final grades only. No scale will be made for
individual assignments.

| Letter Grade | Percent |
|--------------|---------|
| A+           | >= 97%  |
| A            | >= 93%  |
| A-           | >= 90%  |
| B+           | >= 87%  |
| B            | >= 83%  |
| B-           | >= 80%  |
| C+           | >= 77%  |
| C            | >= 73%  |
| C-           | >= 70%  |
| D+           | >= 67%  |
| D            | >= 63%  |
| D-           | >= 60%  |
| F            | < 60%   |

### Labs

There are weekly labs that give you hands-on exercises for topics
recently covered in lecture. The purpose of lab is not only to give you
further working experience with lecture topics, but also to provide you
with additional information and details not necessarily covered in
lecture. Each lab will come with some starter code and exercises that
you have to complete.  You will submit your code as specified through
the webhandin and we will grade your lab using the webgrader.
 
Labs are setup as a *peer programming* experience. If you are attending 
lab *in person*, you may be randomly paired with a partner. One of you 
will be the *driver* and the other will be the *navigator*. The navigator 
will be responsible for reading the instructions and guiding the driver. 
The driver will be in charge of the keyboard and will type the code. Both 
driver and navigator are responsible for developing and working through 
solutions *together*.  Neither the navigator nor the driver is "in charge."
This is an equal collaboration and all efforts should be equally shared.
Beyond your immediate pairing, you are encouraged to help and interact 
and with other pairs in the lab.  If you are attending lab remotely or 
online, you may be paired up with another person virtually if you choose
or you may complete the lab on your own.

### Assignments

There are 8 assignments. Assignments will be due 1 second before
midnight Friday evening the week that they are due. Code and other
relevant *artifacts* must be submitted using CSE’s webhandin. If there
are written portions of the homework, they should be typed. You should
typeset code snippets using a monotype font (Courier for example) for
readability. Figures may be hand drawn, but you are encouraged to use
some sort of software to render them.

In this course, most of the assignments build on prior assignments.
Therefore, it is extremely important for you to stay on task and not
fall behind with assignments. You should start on assignments early and
resolve any and all issues (bugs, design flaws) as soon as possible so
they do not carry over to the next assignment.

### 15th Week Policy Notification

A per UNL’s 15th Week Policy (available here:
<https://registrar.unl.edu/academic-standards/policies/fifteenth-week-policy/>)
we are required to serve written notice that the final assignment as
well as the final lab will be due during the 15th week or "dead week."

### Grading Policy

If you have questions about grading or believe that points were deducted
unfairly, you must first address the issue with the individual who
graded it to see if it can be resolved. Such questions should be made
within a reasonable amount of time after the graded assignment has been
returned. No further consideration will be given to any assignment a
week after it grades have been posted. It is important to emphasize that
the goal of grading is consistency. A grade on any given assignment,
even if it is low for the entire class, should not matter that much.
Rather, students who do comparable work should receive comparable grades
(see the subsection on the scale used for this course).

### Late Work Policy

In general, there will be no make-up or late work accepted.
Exceptions may be made in certain circumstances such as health or
emergency, but you must make every effort to get prior permission.
Documentation may also be required.

Homework assignments have a strict due date/time as defined by the CSE
server’s system clock. All program files must be handed in using CSE’s
webhandin as specified in individual assignment handouts. Programs that
are even a few seconds past the due date/time will be considered late
and you will be locked out of handing anything in after that time.

### Webgrader Policy

Failure to adhere to the requirements of an assignment in such a manner
that makes it impossible to grade your program via the webgrader means
that a disproportionate amount of time would be spent evaluating your
assignment. For this reason, we will not grade any assignment that does
not compile and run through the webgrader.

### Academic Integrity

All homework assignments, programs, and exams must represent your own
work unless otherwise stated. No collaboration with fellow students,
past or current, is allowed unless otherwise permitted on specific
assignments or problems. The Department of Computer Science &
Engineering has an Academic Integrity Policy. All students enrolled in
any computer science course are bound by this policy. You are expected
to read, understand, and follow this policy. Violations will be dealt
with on a case by case basis and may result in a failing assignment or a
failing grade for the course itself. The most recent version of the
Academic Integrity Policy can be found at
<http://cse.unl.edu/academic-integrity>

## Honors Section

For those in the Honors section of this course topics will be covered at
a faster pace so that additional "advanced" topics can also be covered.

In addition, each assignment may contain additional requirements or
problems that must be completed. There may also be additional
assignments. Bottom line, there will be higher expectations with regard
to the quality and quantity of work in this course compared to the
regular section. As a student in this course, you will be expected to
meet or exceed those expectations which may require more of your time
and a more proactive approach to studying and greater diligence in
completely assignments.

## Communication & Getting Help

The primary means of communication for this course is Piazza, an online
forum system designed for college courses. We have established a Piazza
group for this course and you should have received an invitation to
join. If you have not, contact the instructor immediately. With Piazza
you can ask questions anonymously, remain anonymous to your classmates,
or choose to be identified. Using this open forum system the entire
class benefits from the instructor and TA responses. In addition, you
and other students can also answer each other’s questions (again you may
choose to remain anonymous or identify yourself to the instructors or
everyone). You may still email the instructor or TAs, but more than
likely you will be redirected to Piazza for help.

In addition, there are is an anonymous suggestion box that you may use
to voice your concerns about any problems in the course if you do not
wish to be identified. It is available at
<https://cse.unl.edu/contact-form>.

### Learning Assistant Program (LAP)

This course is supported by the CSE Learning Assistant Program (LAP).  
The mission of the LAP is to improve student comprehension and 
retention in computing fields by focusing on the learner's experience. 
This course will be supplemented by Learning Assistants (LAs) and Course 
Leaders (CLs) to help improve your learning. LAs and CLs are other 
undergraduate students who have taken the same or similar courses 
and have been trained to help you succeed in this course. Your LAs 
and CLs will hold regular office hours, help with grading, and assist 
you with labs/assignments.

I strongly encourage you to utilize the LAs and CLs when you are 
completing coursework. More information can be found in the Learning 
Assistant Program Module on Canvas.

### Getting Help

Your success in this course is ultimately your responsibility. Your
success in this course depends on how well you utilize the opportunities
and resources that we provide. There are numerous outlets for learning
the material and getting help in this course:

-   Lectures: attend lectures regularly and when you do use the time
    appropriately. Do not distract yourself with social media or other
    time wasters. Actively take notes (electronic or hand written). It
    is well-documented that good note taking directly leads to
    understanding and retention of concepts.

-   Lecture Videos: Lecture videos are intended as a supplement that
    mirrors lecture material but that may not cover everything. Watch
    them at your own pace on a regular basis for reiteration or in case
    you missed something in lecture.

-   Required Reading: do the required reading on a regular basis. The
    readings provide additional details and depth that you may not
    necessarily get directly in lecture.

-   Labs: use your time during labs wisely. Engage with your lab
    instructors, teaching assistants, your partner(s) and other
    students. Be sure to adequately prepare for labs by reading the
    handouts before coming to lab. Get started and don’t get distracted.

-   Piazza: if you have questions ask them on Piazza. It is the best and
    likely fastest way to get help with your questions. Also, be sure to
    read other student’s posts and questions and feel free to answer
    yourself!

-   Office Hours & Student Resource Center: the instructor and teaching
    assistants hold regular office hours throughout the week as posted
    on the course website. Attend office hours if you have questions or
    want to review material. The Student Resource Center (SRC,
    <http://cse.unl.edu/src>) Monday through Friday. Even if your TAs
    are not scheduled during that time, there are plenty of other TAs
    and students present that may be able to help. And, you may be able
    to help others!

-   Don’t procrastinate. The biggest reason students fail this course is
    because they do not give themselves enough opportunities to learn
    the material. Don’t wait to the last minute to start your
    assignments. Many people wait to the last minute and flood the TAs
    and SRC, making it difficult to get help as the due date approaches.
    Don’t underestimate how much time your assignment(s) will take and
    don’t wait to the week before hand to get started. Ideally, you
    should be working on the problems as we are covering them.

-   Get help in the *right way*: when you go to the instructor or TA for
    help, you must demonstrate that you have put forth a good faith
    effort toward understanding the material. Asking questions that
    clearly indicate you have failed to read the required material, have
    not been attending lecture, etc. is *not acceptable*. Don’t ask
    generic questions like "I’m lost, I don’t know what I’m doing".
    Instead, explain what you have tried so far. Explain why you think
    what you have tried doesn’t seem to be working. Then the TA will
    have an easier time to help you identify misconceptions or problems.
    This is known as "Rubber Duck Debugging" where in if you try to
    explain a problem to someone (or, lacking a live person, a rubber
    duck), then you can usually identify the problem yourself. Or, at
    the very least, get some insight as to what might be wrong.
