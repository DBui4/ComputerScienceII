### Object Oriented Programming


## Objects

### Creating and Designing Classes: Demo

* Java is a "class"-based object oriented programming language
* Everything in Java is a class or belongs to a class
* A `class` in Java:
  * allows you to model a "real world" object or idea or "entity"
  * allows you to *group* multiple pieces of data together into one logical unit
  * also allows you to *encapsulate* methods within the class that *act on* or *operate on* that class's data (ie functionality)
  * IE: it allows you to group functionality together with the data that it operates on
  * Java classes also allow you to *protect* data from outside of the class
* First demonstration: design a class that models a radioactive isotope

## Objects

* Formally an object is a general entity characterized by:
1. Identity: an aspect of the object that distinguishes it from all other instances
2. State: a collection of properties (elements, attributes, data, fields, *member variables*)
3. Behavior: the functionality of the object or what it *does* or the services it provides

* Communication between objects is done via "message sending": you invoke a method on an object and that object executes the code inside that method
* Communication is facilitated by the object's *interface*: the `public` methods that are available
* Objects are *constructed* rather than just assigned
  * In Java, by default a no-argument constructor is provided
  * If you define your OWN constructor, it goes away
  * You can always restore it by explicitly defining it
  * You can define as many constructors as you wish to make your objects more usable
* Common patterns:
  * Copy constructors that take another instance of the object and make a deep copy
  * Partial copy constructors: copy constructors that take an object and other values to make a (partial) copy of the object
