### Introduction to Java

# Basics

* Java is a class-based Objected Oriented Programming language
* Translation: everything in Java is either a `class` or belongs to a class
* Classes are simply units of code that are declared in their own source file: class name is `HelloWorld`, then the source file MUST be `HelloWorld.java`
* Source files are compiled to Java Virtual Machine (JVM) code
* IDEs like Eclipse can hide these details
* Classes are organized in *packages*: packages are simply just directories (folders)
* Packages provide organization of your classes
